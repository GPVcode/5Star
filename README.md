Define Model:

Create a Mongoose model for matches in the models/ directory (e.g., Match.js).
Include fields like title, description, ratings, host, etc., in the schema.
Create Routes:

Define a route in the matchRoutes.js file to handle rating a match.
Set up a POST endpoint like /matches/:matchId/rate to submit ratings.
Create Controller:

Create a controller function (in matchController.js) to handle the rating logic.
Inside the controller, extract the matchId from the request parameters and the rating value from the request body.
Use Mongoose to find the match by matchId, update its ratings array with the new rating, and calculate the average rating.
Authentication Middleware:

If only authenticated users should be able to rate matches, create an authentication middleware (authMiddleware.js) to ensure the user is logged in before rating.
Testing:

Write unit tests for your controller function to ensure it's working as expected.
Use testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha along with tools like supertest to simulate API requests.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling in your controller to catch and handle potential errors, such as invalid match IDs or ratings.
Route Integration:

Integrate the rating route into your main index.js file by using app.use() and pointing to your matchRoutes.js.
Front-End Integration:

On the front end (if applicable), create a UI element where the host can input a rating for a match (e.g., a set of stars).
Use JavaScript to capture the selected rating and send a POST request to the /matches/:matchId/rate endpoint.
Remember to structure your code in a modular way and separate concerns. Start by creating the Mongoose model, defining the routes, implementing the controller logic, and testing each step along the way. This approach will help you incrementally build and test your feature.
